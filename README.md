## About
speedcontrol-layouts was the layout pack used during Horror(ible) Games 2021 - Heartbreak, tweaked to make creating layouts easier.

### Features
- 14 easy-to-use and customizable layouts with deteiled documentation
- Full Tiltify support, showing total amount raised and incentives/prizes
- A sponsor area, for showcasing products and other events
- Various Photoshop files to easily make your own layouts

## Requirements
Administrator privileges will be needed to install. Some of these programs use the command line, you should be comfortable using Command Prompt or similar.
- [Git For Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NodeCG](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg)
- [NodeCG Speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol)

For [NodeCG Speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol), you need to use the dev branch with a version commited after February 1st, 2021 for custom data to work correctly. If you do not know how to build the files, I have a compatible build that you can use found [here](https://github.com/nicnacnic/nodecg-speedcontrol). Note that this version will get more out-of-date over time as I don't plan to update it.

Additionally, although not required, some basic knowledge of Java/Javascript, HTML and CSS will make it easier to customize these layouts.

## Installation
To install this layout pack, navigate to your root NodeCG folder using Command Prompt or similar (I like [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)). Then, type in the following command and press enter.

```nodecg install nicnacnic/speedcontrol-layouts```

After the installation completes, type the following command to create a config file, found in ```<path_to_nodecg>/cfg```.

```nodecg defaultconfig speedcontrol-layouts```

To start NodeCG, navigate to the main NodeCG folder in Command Prompt, then type `nodecg start`.

For a full user and customization guide, the [wiki](https://github.com/nicnacnic/speedcontrol-layouts/wiki) will have everything you need to know! 

## Using These Layouts
This layout pack includes many layouts with many different aspect ratios, including 4:3 and 16:9 (from 1p to 4p), GB, GBA, DS, 3DS, intermission, and a customizable omnibar. Photoshop files are also included for easy editing, from simply changing the colors to rearranging elements in your layout. And detailed documentation ensures you know what you're doing.

If you end up using speedcontrol-layouts during your marathon/event, it would be greatly appreciated if you included the repository name and author in your end credits. Thank you!
